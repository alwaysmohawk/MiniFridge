# MiniFridge
## Fridge Door for v0's

V0.2 Mini Fridge Door Handle ready for business! This project is a revision of WhoppingPochard’s Clicky-Clack Door mod commonly known as or referred to as “Fridge Door Mod” or simply the “Fridge Door”

I needed a better door for my v0.2 the flip up lid isn’t necessary to me so I created the “Mini Fridge Version 1” Then I realized I could shrink WhoppingPochard’s Clicky-Clack Door and re-fit it for the v0’s 3mm slot extrusions.

# Special thanks to whoppingpochard for creating the original mod for the 2.4 and Trident found here:

https://github.com/tanaes/whopping_Voron_mods/tree/main/clickyclacky_door

The printed parts list is for 2 variations we have encountered during the testing phase. 
1.	Stock Panels (No Foam)
2.	Panels with 3mm Foam
During the testing phase Fizzy Tech Discord Server Admin Robert found out he could use TOPHAT extrusion kit to have the 200mm X bars with threads ready to go along with the LDO Micron 3D Printer Frame Kit Extrusions kit for the Z Bars that were needed to enclose the panels in.

ISSUES:
1.	if your running any screen other than the stock one you need to either print Fizzy Tech Discord Server Admin Jose’s skirt extenders for HartK’s Stealthchop mod with Waveshare 2.8” screen found here: https://github.com/hartk1213/MISC/tree/main/Voron%20Mods/Voron%200/0.2/2_8WaveshareDisplay/Stealth/STLs/Stealth
