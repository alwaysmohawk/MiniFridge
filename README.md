# MiniFridge
## Fridge Door for v0's

This is a fork of the project by The Voron Modder. While the design work he did is awesome, and I'm happy with the outcome of my fridge door build, I found the github repo needed some help. I'm not very familiar with Github, so instead of sending a tonne of pull requests I thought I'd fork it and see how clean I can get the repo.

The Mini Fridge Door Mod is a version of WhoppingPochard's Clicky-Clack Door Mod, commonly referred to as the Fridge Door Mod.

Issues: You may have issues with the location of the stock screen once the door is installed. While it doesn't interfere, it's readability is diminished. A server admin for Fizzy Tech's Discord server, Jose, designed some skirt extenders, which may rectify this issue.

You may be able to source the extrusions by buying a tophat extrusion kit.

I used cheap 1515 extrusions off Aliexpress. While they were very affordable, I'm not sure I'd use them again. Their holes are too big to fit m3 hardware, so I had to tap them and print little spacers to thread in so that I could use m3 screws. I also had to design some "no drop nuts" or nut retention brackets since the channel of the extrusion was too wide.

### Special thanks to whoppingpochard for creating the original mod for the 2.4 and Trident found here:

The printed parts list is for 2 variations we have encountered during the testing phase. 
1.	Stock Panels (No Foam)
2.	Panels with 3mm Foam
During the testing phase Fizzy Tech Discord Server Admin Robert found out he could use TOPHAT extrusion kit to have the 200mm X bars with threads ready to go along with the LDO Micron 3D Printer Frame Kit Extrusions kit for the Z Bars that were needed to enclose the panels in.

ISSUES:
1.	if your running any screen other than the stock one you need to either print Fizzy Tech Discord Server Admin Jose’s skirt extenders for HartK’s Stealthchop mod with Waveshare 2.8” screen found here: https://github.com/hartk1213/MISC/tree/main/Voron%20Mods/Voron%200/0.2/2_8WaveshareDisplay/Stealth/STLs/Stealth
